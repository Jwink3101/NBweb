- [X] Add a wrapper/plugin so that if there is ever a ?nav=xyz, it will do the forward for you. Then, (a) remove the nav logic from main_route, (b) remove the /_nav/ path, (c) change fill_template's special page nav route to just add the ?nav= (since it will get picked up by the wrapper) and (d) allow new buttons on special pages. The wrapper will also need to parse out special routes so: /_all/path/to/dir/?nav=xyz will go to /_xyz/path/to/dir/ but without nav login in the _all path (or any path)
